Supporting information for: an investigation currently in progress.

The input shell scripts for tensile simulations of VP structures using DFT calculations with the aid of VASP package. Here, the [VASPKIT](https://vaspkit.com) package is used  to generate the KPOINTS and POTCAR files, and the [VASP OPT AXIS code](https://github.com/Chengcheng-Xiao/VASP_OPT_AXIS) is used to  fix stress tensor component(s) during tensile simulations.
